# Find-On-Git
FIND ON GIT is a web application designed to facilitate user search for GitHub profiles and display detailed information alongside repositories. Leveraging the Axios library for asynchronous HTTP requests to the GitHub API, user data and repositories are dynamically fetched and displayed in real-time. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application enables seamless searching of GitHub users and presents their profiles with relevant information. Error handling mechanisms are implemented to provide users with appropriate messages in cases of profile not found or repository fetching issues, thereby enhancing overall user engagement and experience.
